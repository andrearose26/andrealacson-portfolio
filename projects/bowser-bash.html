                <p>As a child, I used to play a game called National Neopian on Neopets. Unfortunately, this game is no longer playable with the deprication of Flash. So I wanted to re-create this game for the sake of nostalgia!</p>
                <p>This project is created using jQuery. When the user presses the spacebar key on the start page, multiple things occur. Characters begin to appear on the page at different intervals, the level counter begins to increase after a certain amount of time. </p>

            <div class="project-description">
                <p>The amount of characters used makes this game a little more complicated. There are four characters: two of which result in an increase of points when caught, and two which result in a decrease in points.</p>

                <p>To determine the points system, I determined what character was in the door, and whether the user was correct, and how many points to give or take. On top of that, I had to make sure that characters would not appear in the same door at the same time.</p>
